AMD 6900 XT is the new addition of AMD graphic card that is said to be the game changer as it perform a lot better then their Rivals Nvidia new series cards. AMD 6900 XT is a very powerful card and to make full use of its power not only CPU (processor) you will need everything of top quality to make full use of it but to avoid the bottleneck it will be mostly depend on the CPU. We have created a list of options for you to consider what will match best with the AMD 6900 XT. The best CPU for AMD 6900 XT are given below.

AMD Ryzen 5 5600X is the best choice as an overall price based and performance based for the AMD 6900 XT as it has enough power to run the card without any bottleneck. This doesn't mean that there are no other CPUs that can out perform it but it is the best choice in our point of view for the beastly AMD 6900XT. As you can see it has the TDP of 65W meaning it will not consume much electricity even when running at 100% which we don't think will be the case pairing it with the AMD 6900 XT. So probably the overall best CPU for AMD 6900XT is the AMD 6900 XT. It only as 12 Threads and 6 Cores as compared to some CPU which has the double amount of Cores/Threads but this doesn't affect the performance as much as with the AMD 6900XT unless you want to pair multiple AMD 6900xt with it.
